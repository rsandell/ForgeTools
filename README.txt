ForgeTools is a mod for Minecraft Forge based servers which gives server 
administrators access to information about the server from in-game such as
server lag (tick rate), number of entities in each dimension, how many chunks
are force-loaded in each dimension, and information about the current dimension

Additionally, it provides some basic tools for cleaning up entities on the
server, and enabling the commands to be used by a set of non-OP players
configured by an OP or server admin.

ForgeTools is currently running off of Forge 7.8.1.738 and MCP v7.51 for Minecraft
1.5.2.  It is behind to match the development of the Feed the Beast modpack so
server managers can use it with FTB.

Minecraft Forge 7.8.1.738 is available at:
